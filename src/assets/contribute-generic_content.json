      "en": "<strong>Citizen Scientists</strong> are active in many disciplines of natural science (such as astronomy, physics, biochemistry, neuroscience, and more), but also in the social sciences as well as in the arts and humanities (such as linguistics, history, archaeology, and more). Projects exist in various forms, catering to people of diverse ages and backgrounds, and are accessible for individuals without a scientific background, as long as they have the time and the tools (often a computer with internet connection or a smartphone, sometimes a data collection kit)."
