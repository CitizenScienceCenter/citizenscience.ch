      "en": "<p>Community building at the Center means facilitating the growth of an active group of academic researchers, citizen scientists and partner organizations through various types of interaction. In-person and online, we create opportunities for them to connect, interact, share, and grow. By actively involving people with different backgrounds and expertise, Citizen Science expands the way of doing excellent science. Engaging the public to participate in scientific research, as well as engaging academic scientists to open up their work for the collaboration with citizens, adds creativity, ability, capacity, speed and impact to the process of generating knowledge. Our Citizen Science Community is growing and spans Zurich and beyond. It consists of local communities of professional scientists and citizen scientists, including members of <strong>UZH</strong>, <strong>ETH Zurich</strong>, local communities in Zurich and Switzerland, Zurich community, as well as a wider network of contributors including our partners and members.</p>",
